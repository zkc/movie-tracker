# Movie Tracker

#### Live: https://movie-tracker-1611.herokuapp.com/

  This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api. Simple card based layout using accounts for saving individual's favorites.
  
 My favorite part of this project is the use of thunk action creators to DRY up logic behind the 'favorites' toggle button. This allowed for the 'favorite button' component to be reused anywhere (anywhere there's a movie-id) without concern for the location of the component.
